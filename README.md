## Vision

SwiftDevKit aims to be your go-to toolkit for common development tasks, offering a wide range of functionalities from data conversion to code generation. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive, well-tested, and professionally crafted SDK that brings the power of web-based developer tools natively to Swift.

## Features

### Text Processing

SwiftDevKit provides powerful text processing tools for common string manipulation tasks:

#### String Transformations
- Case transformations (toTitleCase, toCamelCase, toSnakeCase, toKebabCase)
- Smart string truncation with customizable length and ellipsis
- Whitespace handling (removeExcessWhitespace)

#### String Extraction
- Extract numbers (with optional negative number handling)
- Extract words with minimum length filtering
- Extract sentences from text
- Extract URLs with custom scheme filtering
- Extract email addresses
- Extract hashtags and mentions (social media style)
- Extract dates from text

### Time Utilities
- Comprehensive timezone management and conversions
- Time formatting and parsing
- Date and time calculations
- Time interval operations

### Conversion Utilities
- Color conversions (RGB, HSL, HSB, Hex)
- Number formatting with locale support
- Date formatting and parsing
- Numeric string conversions
- Custom string conversion protocols

### Currently Implemented
