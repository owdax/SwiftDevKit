Think of it as your Swiss Army knife for Swift development - all the tools you need, right in your native environment.

## Vision

SwiftDevKit aims to be your go-to toolkit for common development tasks, offering a wide range of functionalities from data conversion to code generation. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive, well-tested, and professionally crafted SDK that brings the power of web-based developer tools natively to Swift.

## Features

### Text Processing

Transform and manipulate strings with ease:

```swift
// Case transformations
"hello world".toTitleCase()      // "Hello World"
"hello world".toCamelCase()      // "helloWorld"
"hello world".toSnakeCase()      // "hello_world"
"hello world".toKebabCase()      // "hello-world"

// String truncation
let text = "This is a long text that needs to be truncated"
text.truncate(length: 10)              // "This i..."
text.truncate(length: 20)              // "This is a long t..."
text.truncate(length: 10, ellipsis: "‚Ä¶") // "This is‚Ä¶"
text.truncate(length: 10, ellipsis: "")  // "This is a"

// Whitespace handling
"hello   world".removeExcessWhitespace()  // "hello world"
```
